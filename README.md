# neotiles

neotiles is a Python library which allows you to divide either a
[neopixel matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=neopixel%20matrix) or an
[RGB matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=rgb%20matrix) into independent
animated tiles for rendering based on arbitrary input data.  Each tile can
display something different: a block of color, an animation, scrolling text, or
whatever else you can implement; and all the tiles can be displayed in
different regions of a single matrix.

Complete documentation is available on
[Read the Docs](http://neotiles.readthedocs.io).

Although you can `pip install neotiles` there's additional dependencies that
you may need to install manually.  See the
[installation instructions](http://neotiles.readthedocs.io/pages/installation.html).
