# neotiles

neotiles is a Python library which allows you to split a
[neopixel matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=neopixel%20matrix) into
independent animated tiles for rendering based on arbitrary input data.  Each
tile can display something different: a block of color, an animation, scrolling
text, whatever you like; and all the tiles can be displayed in different
regions of a single neopixel matrix.

Complete documentation is available on
[Read the Docs](http://neotiles.readthedocs.io).
